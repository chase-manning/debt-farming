# Debt Farming

Debt Farming is a website that helps identify debt farming opportunities. Which is essentially arbitrage between the borrow rate of an asset, and the yield that asset can generate. 

The site is built using React pulls data from several sources to collate the output.  

It is a free tool, feel free to do whatever you want with the source code :smiley:
